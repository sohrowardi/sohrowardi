# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mohammad Sohrowardi, a passionate learner and aspiring Python developer. Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here, you'll find a collection of projects that I've been working on as I explore the exciting world of programming. Feel free to take a look around and explore some of the things I've been building.

## About Me

I'm relatively new to programming, but I'm eager to learn and grow with each project I tackle. My journey started with simple scripts and has evolved into more complex applications as I've gained confidence and skills along the way. I believe in the power of programming to solve problems and make a positive impact, and I'm excited to see where this journey takes me.
